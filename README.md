#Welcome to My Weather App(https://howztheweather.netlify.app/)

This application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It also utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management, Framer Motion for animations, and the OpenWeather API for retrieving current weather data.

To get started, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, clone the repository and run npm install to install all of the dependencies.

You will also need to sign up for an API key from the OpenWeather website in order to use the app. 

To start a development server, run npm start. This will start the server on http://localhost:3000 and will automatically reload the page when changes are made.

To build the application for production, run npm run build.

Thank you for visiting my weather app! I hope you find it useful in getting your current weather information.
