# [Weather app](https://howztheweather.netlify.app/)

Weather app created with react, redux toolkit, framer motion and open weather api. 
I have created a weather app before which you can see live [here](https://paulkhoza.herokuapp.com/weather/) the main reason for creating this was was to learn react hooks.
